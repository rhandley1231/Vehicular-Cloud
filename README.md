# Vehicular-Cloud
Capstone project for Software Engineering course.  Based on the concept of vehicular-cloud computing, this project serves as a mock interface for a system that would implement this idea.  

This is a java and MySQL stack.  
- The project utilizes a local MySQL server, so ensure you set one up using the table schema provided in my codebase, and adjust your username and password accordingly.
- The frontend is handled with Java Swing. 
- The backend is handled with simple java classes.
  
The project supports concurrent threads, alllowing for us to run multiple instances of the cRRrun (client) class.
  
Follow the MP4 demo attached to see how the program operates.
